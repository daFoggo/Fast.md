# NOTICE
- The current project  will use Springboot as backend only for now cause I have to work on a Java course's final project.
- In future, I will only use local storage for user's privacy.
- For now, if you are interested, you can clone the project and deploy it if you want.

# INSTALLATION
```
git clone https://github.com/daFoggo/fast.md.git
